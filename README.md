# Baseline
### Reusable Components

Baseline is a collection of reusable web components that can be applied to any user interface or design pattern.  The reusability focusses on the main design elements, data structure, HTML, and user interactions required to design any variation of a component.  It is meant to describe the 80% of a component that is similar to other versions of the same component but accepts that nothing is every 100% reusable.
